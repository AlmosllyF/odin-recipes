    <h1>Cast Iron Pan-Seared Steak (Oven-Finished)</h1>
    <img src="images/Steak.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Steak is marinated in the fridge for 45 minutes, then quickly pan-seared
        in a cast iron skillet before it is finished in the oven.
    </p>
    <p>
        The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains
        heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast
        iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized
        crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron
        skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at
        least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook
        before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course,
        this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li> 2 cups orange juice</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire
            sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room
            temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>

        <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>

        <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until
            browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to
            the oven.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)
            to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
